# W10TelemetryBlocklist
PiHole compatible blocklist for Windows 10 Telemetry domains.

This list was compiled by viewing the domains blocked by the apps "Destroy Windows Spying", "ShutUp10", and "WDP." List originally posted on Reddit by u/tplgigo, with duplicates removed and lines alphabetized by "yours truly.

PLEASE NOTE: This list is quite strict and WILL break some things such as Windows updates 10 and Skype, for example. I am working on a new list for Windows 10 that will hopefully remove these issues and cover more domains.
